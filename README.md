## Wordy Extension
### A word frequency util in a chrome extension

Wordy lists the words on the current web page by usage frequency. 

###Installation
Drag [wordy-extension.crx](https://github.com/angus-c/wordy-extension/blob/master/wordy-extension.crx) to your chrome extensions page.  
I'll probably add it to the store at some point

###Usage

Adjust the slidy bar to set the minimum word size for the search
